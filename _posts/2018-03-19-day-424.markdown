1/ **Jeff Sessions fired Andrew McCabe, the now-former deputy director of the FBI, 24 hours before he was set to retire**. Sessions announced the decision to fire McCabe just before 10 pm ET on Friday, saying McCabe was fired because he "made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor — including under oath — on multiple occasions." In an interview, McCabe defended himself. "The idea that I was dishonest is just wrong," he said. McCabe added: "This is part of an effort to discredit me as a witness" and undermine Robert Mueller's investigation into the Trump campaign.

2/ **McCabe met with Mueller and turned over memos detailing his interactions with Trump**, similar to the notes compiled by James Comey. The memos, apparently, include corroborating details about the firing of former FBI Director James Comey. It's unclear when McCabe's interview took place.

3/ **Trump's personal lawyer wants Rod Rosenstein to end Mueller's investigation** into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. "I pray that Acting Attorney General Rosenstein will follow the brilliant and courageous example of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and bring an end to alleged Russia Collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe's boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt Dossier," John Dowd wrote in an email comment about McCabe's firing. Dowd initially said he was speaking on behalf of Trump "as his counsel," but later said he was not speaking on the president's behalf.

4/ **Trump attacked Mueller by name for the first time on Twitter, calling the special counsel's investigation "WITCH HUNT!" in a tweet**. Trump also charged that the memos written by James Comey and Andrew McCabe were "Fake Memos" because he "spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me." In one tweet, Trump also complained that Mueller's team is partisan with "13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans?" Mueller and Rosenstein are both Republicans.

5/ **Republican senators warned Trump not to fire Robert Mueller and to let federal investigators do their jobs**. Lindsey Graham said if Trump were to dismiss Mueller, it would mark "the beginning of the end of his presidency." Trey Gowdy, meanwhile, said if Trump is innocent, he should "act like it" and leave Mueller alone. Paul Ryan issued a statement urging Trump that "Mueller and his team should be able to do their job." Mitch McConnell, however, had no comment. Following the pushback, White House lawyer Ty Cobb issued a statement on Sunday night saying Trump was not considering firing Mueller.

### Notables.

1. **Three sources contradicted Jeff Sessions' claims that he "pushed back" against a George Papadopoulos proposal for Trump's campaign to meet with Russians in 2016**. Some Democrats think the discrepancies in Sessions' testimony suggest the attorney general may have committed perjury. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-sessions-exclusive/exclusive-sources-contradict-sessions-testimony-he-opposed-russia-outreach-idUSKBN1GU0NC))

2. **Jared Kushner's family real estate company routinely filed false documents with the New York City housing department**. Kushner Cos. claimed that it had zero rent-regulated tenants, even though there were actually hundreds of said tenants living in dozens of buildings it owned throughout the city. The move allowed the company to circumvent rules that would have prevented developers from pushing low-rent tenants out of the buildings.

3. **Senior White House officials are considering whether to re-hire Trump's personal aide John McEntee**, days after he was abruptly fired and escorted off the property. The reasons for McEntee's firing are still unclear, but it is believed to be related to issues surrounding his gambling habits.
